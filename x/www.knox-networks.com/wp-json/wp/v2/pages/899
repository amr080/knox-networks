It requires affected companies to create processes to comply with and facilitate consumer data requests, to update their privacy policies, and to ensure that PII is secured.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, the GDPR and other national privacy laws provide data subjects with certain rights regarding their PII.
